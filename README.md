COVAR and AKFIT are codes that solve complex calculations with statistical analysis for Neutron Activation Analysis (Nuclear Physics).

COVAR aims to improve the calculation of k0 and Q0 parameters, adding another method of calculating k0 factor and improving unvertainties with the covariance analysis.

AKFIT aims the development of a new method of calculating the alpha and several k0 parameters in a single least square fit, by means of a novel methodology, using covariance matrices and all partial uncertainties and also have a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with the purpose to make calculations with machine learning.
